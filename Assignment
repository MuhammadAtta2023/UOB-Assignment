# UOB  {BSCS} 1st samister -Assignment
It is my first semester fundamentals of programing  Assignment .
In this program my program will ask from the user to input a number between 2 and 100.
If the user input a number that is among 2 and 100 the program will call the function that isprime()
and if the number is prime it will return 1, if it is not prime it will return 0.
If the user input  another number that it is not in the range of 1 and 100.
so the program  will give output that the number is not in the range {press 1 to retry}.
If the user pess 1 than again the program will ask input a number between 2 and 100.

So that is the totaly working system of my program .
